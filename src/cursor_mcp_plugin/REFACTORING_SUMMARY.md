# Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. **Project Structure**
- Created a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Organized code into logical directories: `commands`, `handlers`, `services`, `utils`, `types`, and `constants`
- Implemented TypeScript support throughout the project

### 2. **Build System**
- Set up Webpack for module bundling
- Configured TypeScript compilation
- Created npm scripts for development and production builds

### 3. **Code Organization**

#### Before (Single File - 3925 lines):
```
code.js
├── All commands mixed together
├── Helper functions scattered throughout
├── No type safety
└── Difficult to maintain and extend
```

#### After (Modular Structure):
```
src/
├── commands/          # Command implementations by category
├── handlers/          # Request routing and orchestration
├── services/          # Business logic and cross-cutting concerns
├── utils/            # Reusable helper functions
├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
└── constants/        # Centralized constants
```

### 4. **Type Safety**
- Added TypeScript types for all major data structures
- Implemented proper error handling with meaningful messages
- Added type checking at compile time

### 5. **Maintainability**
- Each command is now a separate function in its own file
- Easy to find, modify, or add new commands
- Clear import/export structure
- Consistent naming conventions

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Code Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easy to locate and modify specific features
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents many runtime errors
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
5. **Better Developer Experience**: IntelliSense, auto-completion, and type checking
6. **Performance**: Webpack optimizes the bundle size
7. **Testability**: Individual functions can be easily unit tested

## How to Continue

### To Add New Commands:
1. Create a new file in the appropriate `commands/` subdirectory
2. Export it from the category's index file
3. Add the command name to `constants/index.ts`
4. Add the case to `handlers/commandHandler.ts`

### To Migrate Remaining Commands:
1. Follow the migration plan in `MIGRATION.md`
2. Extract helper functions to `utils/`
3. Use services for cross-cutting concerns
4. Add proper TypeScript types

### Best Practices Going Forward:
- Always use TypeScript types for parameters and return values
- Keep commands focused on a single responsibility
- Use services for shared business logic
- Extract reusable code to utilities
- Document complex logic with comments
- Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages

## File Size Comparison

- **Original**: `code.js` - 111KB (3925 lines)
- **Compiled**: `dist/code.js` - 9.7KB (minified)
- **Source**: Multiple TypeScript files, easier to maintain

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration of remaining commands (see `MIGRATION.md`)
2. Add unit tests for critical functionality
3. Implement logging service for better debugging
4. Add validation schemas for command parameters
5. Create developer documentation
6. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated builds

The foundation is now in place for a maintainable, scalable Figma plugin architecture.
